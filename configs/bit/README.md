## Introduction

Transfer of pre-trained representations improves sample efficiency and simplifies hyperparameter tuning when training deep neural networks for vision.
Big Transfer (BiT) can achieve strong performance on more than 20 data sets by combining some carefully selected components and using simple heuristic
methods for transmission. The components distilled by BiT for training models that transfer well are: 1) Big datasets: as the size of the dataset increases,
the optimal performance of the BIT model will also increase. 2) Big architectures: In order to make full use of large datasets, a large enough architecture
is required. 3) Long pre-training time: Pretraining on a larger dataset requires more training epoch and training time. 4) GroupNorm and Weight Standardisation:
BiT use GroupNorm combined with Weight Standardisation instead of BatchNorm. Since BatchNorm performs worse when the number of images on each accelerator is
too low. 5) With BiT fine-tuning, good performance can be achieved even if there are only a few examples of each type on natural images.[[1, 2](#References)]

## Requirements
| mindspore | ascend driver |  firmware   | cann toolkit/kernel |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :---------: | :-----------------: |
|   2.5.0   |   24.1.0      | 7.5.0.3.220 |     8.0.0.beta1     |

## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation

Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindcv/installation/) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation

Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple NPU devices
msrun --bind_core=True --worker_num 8 python train.py --config configs/bit/bit_resnet50_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```


For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on single NPU device
python train.py --config configs/bit/bit_resnet50_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```
python validate.py -c configs/bit/bit_resnet50_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

## Performance

Our reproduced model performance on ImageNet-1K is reported as follows.

Experiments are tested on ascend 910* with mindspore 2.5.0 graph mode.
