## Introduction
<!--- Guideline: Introduce the model and architectures. Please cite if you use/adopt paper explanation from others. -->
<!--- Guideline: If an architecture table/figure is available in the paper, please put one here and cite for intuitive illustration. -->

Figure 1 shows the model architecture of ResNet, DenseNet and Dual Path Networks. By combining the feature reusage of ResNet and new feature introduction of DenseNet,
DPN could enjoy both benefits so that it could share common features and maintain the flexibility to explore new features. As a result, DPN could achieve better performance with
fewer computation cost compared with ResNet and DenseNet on ImageNet-1K dataset.[[1](#references)]

## Requirements
| mindspore | ascend driver |  firmware   | cann toolkit/kernel |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :---------: | :-----------------: |
|   2.5.0   |   24.1.0      | 7.5.0.3.220 |     8.0.0.beta1     |



## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation
Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindcv/installation/) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation
Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training
<!--- Guideline: Please avoid using shell scripts in the command line. Python scripts preferred. -->

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distrubted training on multiple Ascend devices
msrun --bind_core=True --worker_num 8 python train.py --config configs/dpn/dpn92_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```



For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on single NPU device
python train.py --config configs/dpn/dpn92_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```
python validate.py -c configs/dpn/dpn92_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

## Performance

Our reproduced model performance on ImageNet-1K is reported as follows.

Experiments are tested on ascend 910* with mindspore 2.5.0 graph mode.
