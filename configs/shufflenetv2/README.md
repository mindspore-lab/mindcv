## Introduction

A key point was raised in ShuffleNetV2, where previous lightweight networks were guided by computing an indirect measure
of network complexity, namely FLOPs. The speed of lightweight networks is described by calculating the amount of
floating point operations. But the speed of operation was never considered directly. The running speed in mobile devices
needs to consider not only FLOPs, but also other factors such as memory accesscost and platform characterics.

Therefore, based on these two principles, ShuffleNetV2 proposes four effective network design principles.

- MAC is minimized when the input feature matrix of the convolutional layer is equal to the output feature
  matrixchannel (when FLOPs are kept constant).
- MAC increases when the groups of GConv increase (while keeping FLOPs constant).
- the higher the fragmentation of the network design, the slower the speed.
- The impact of Element-wise operation is not negligible.

## Requirements
| mindspore | ascend driver |  firmware   | cann toolkit/kernel |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :---------: | :-----------------: |
|   2.5.0   |   24.1.0      | 7.5.0.3.220 |     8.0.0.beta1     |



## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation

Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindcv/installation/) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation

Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training
and validation.

### Training

<!--- Guideline: Avoid using shell script in the command line. Python script preferred. -->

* Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple
Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple NPU devices
msrun --bind_core=True --worker_num 8 python train.py --config configs/shufflenetv2/shufflenet_v2_0.5_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```


For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer
to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to
keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

* Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on single NPU device
python train.py --config configs/shufflenetv2/shufflenet_v2_0.5_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path
with `--ckpt_path`.

```
python validate.py -c configs/shufflenetv2/shufflenet_v2_0.5_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

## Performance

Our reproduced model performance on ImageNet-1K is reported as follows.

Experiments are tested on ascend 910* with mindspore 2.5.0 graph mode.
